        <ul>
<li>My first day there I did a Sandeman walking tour (these are free, and meet in the center of the city by the Brandenburg Gate. You need to register online in advance of the tour). It’s approx. 2.5 hours, with frequent stops and a break midway through. This was a great way to get oriented to the city and to determine which areas I wanted to explore further on my own. Our guide also had an excellent knowledge of 20th century history (of which Berlin was certainly a prominent city!), and I learned so many details I wouldn’t have discovered otherwise.</li>
<li>If you are interested in visiting a concentration camp, I would recommend visiting Sachsenhausen. It is easily accessed on the Berlin metro (~30 mins from mitte) and was a very powerful experience. I hadn’t heard of Sachsenhausen before my visit, but it was the de-facto “center” of the network of concentration camps. The camp is located in a quaint town bordering Berlin called Oranienburg. If you do choose to go (given the ages of your girls, not sure if this is an activity you were planning on), I would highly recommend renting an audioguide.</li>
<li>The East Side Gallery (also very accessible on the metro) is the portion of the wall still intact and with the graffiti/artwork. Highly recommend! </li>
<li>The Memorial to Jews in Europe (and underground museum, which is free admission). If you do the Sandeman tour, you will visit the Memorial but should definitely return to the museum, it is very well done.</li>
<li>I was visiting Berlin for a conference, and one of the evening events was a dinner cruise along the Spree River. This was fabulous, as many of the main government buildings are right on the water and it was a very cool vantage point. As well, it gave us a chance to see West Berlin which is mainly residential (I didn’t venture there on my own).</li>
<li>The Reichstag Building is the main building where the national government sits. It is free to enter, and walk up the spiral top and out onto the roof, tickets have to be reserved (we did this a day in advance) either online or in person but they go quickly (especially on weekends) so definitely something to plan in advance. </li>
<li>Humboldt University of Berlin (the walking tour ends here) is beautiful and was home to majority of the most famous physicists. Very cool history here (and stunning campus). As well, depending on when you go there will probably be various free artistic events happening throughout the city. I was there in the 3rd week of June, coincidentally at the same time as the “Fete De La Musique Berlin” with free choral, instrumental and solo concerts all around the city that we took advantage of!</li>
<li>FOOD: We tried to hunt down the best Schnitzel in Berlin, and we might have done it at Schnitzelei (Chausseestraße 8, 10115 Berlin, Germany). We had an amazing breakfast at Distrikt Coffee. Otherwise, we ate a wide range of delicious and diverse food (a highlight was the Turkish Kebab, available on every corner!).</li>
<li>As for a day trip—I was torn when picking where to go for a few days after my conference, picking between Leipzig, Potsdam and Dresden. I ended up going to Dresden for 3 nights (it was a 2 hour train ride from Berlin) which was wonderful (quite opposite of Berlin), beautiful old-time Europe feel. Though from the research I did before my trip, you can’t go wrong with any of the smaller towns/cities around Berlin for a day trip! </li>
